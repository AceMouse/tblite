Usage in QCxMS
==============

The `QCxMS`_ project for the quantum chemical simulation of mass spectra\ :footcite:`asgeirsson2017`\ :footcite:`koopman2019` uses *tblite* as backend to implement the GFN1-xTB, GFN2-xTB and IPEA1-xTB Hamiltonians.

.. note::

   Support in QCxMS will be presumably available with version 5.1.0 soon.
